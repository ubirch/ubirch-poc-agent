# Working from Docker Compose

We offer a quick start to start using the system. The repository has two docker compose definitions that can offer a nice and controlled environment.

There are two flavors:

- [Single PoC Agent](#single-poc-agent) : One  to one configuration. One PoC Agent and one UPP Signer.
- [Load Balanced PoC Agent](#load-balanced-poc-agent). HA Proxy, two PoC Agents and one UPP Signer.
